      <p><strong>Falling in Love with Silicon Valley</strong></p>
      <p>
        My flight to San Francisco touched down at around 10:30 PM on Jan 3rd,
        2019 - this was my first time I had ever been to California. Air Canada
        had misplaced our planes luggage, so after waiting for a few hours at
        the airport, we finally arrived at our hotel in Millbrae at around 2am.
        My dad and I were both exhausted, it was a long flight and the
        difference in time zones made it feel like it was much later. We both
        woke up around 7am, and I remember vividly staring out the window,
        watching the sunrise over the water. I didn't know it at the time, but
        the warmth, energy, and beauty of that sunrise would foreshadow so much
        of my experience to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was in California for an internship at
        <a href="https://getkuna.com/">Kuna</a>, my first co-op term through the
        University of Waterloo. I had done internships before, but this one
        somehow felt different, felt real. Over the course of the next year, I
        would get the chance to experience some of what Silicon Valley has to
        offer, and meet people who would change everything for me.
      </p>
      <p>This is the story of how I fell in love with Silicon Valley.</p>
      <p>
        The thing that I noticed during my first week of work was the people -
        they are different from anyone I had ever met before. I didn't really
        know anyone, so I spent most of my time with my co-workers at Kuna
        getting to know them. Each and every one of them had this incredible
        focus, product obsession, optimism, and the confidence to try and make
        tomorrow better than today. It is this spirit that in my opinion drives
        so much of the success of Silicon Valley, this idea that through hard
        work, a small team of people can make a huge difference in the world as
        we know it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the overwhelming concentration of talent at that company, a few
        still managed to stand out above the rest. One in particular was my boss
        at the time, he had this aura around him, he shone (and continues to
        shine) like a bright light. He had gone through YC twice, the second
        time as the co-founder of Kuna. To be honest, one of the best parts of
        that internship was being able to learn how he thought through certain
        problems. He's very down to earth, honest, and most importantly, kind,
        and I think that's what made him successful as a founder. Generally
        speaking, he is the bright shiny thing that I point at when asked who I
        want to be like when I'm older.
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, so you met some cool people and you're a huge simp for your
        ex-boss, is that it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Haha, no, definitely not. One of the coolest things about the valley is
        access, anyone can immerse themselves in Silicon Valley culture with one
        quick easy step, making a Twitter account. There is a tremendous
        community of builders, makers, and founders on "tech-twitter", and it
        was through this community that I met a bunch of people that I would now
        call my best friends. I remember that I had reached out to someone I had
        met on Twitter, and agreed to have dinner with them in San Francisco
        after work. I almost cancelled that meeting because I was too nervous,
        but I'm really glad I didn't. He had an incredible story, and again was
        someone that I wanted to be like when I was older. He ended up
        introducing me to
        <a href="https://twitter.com/_johnnydallas_">Johnny</a>, who eventually
        invited me to be one of the first ~50 or so members of
        <a href="https://genzmafia.com/">Gen Z Mafia</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gen Z Mafia, especially in the early days, was magical. It was this
        amazing group of people who I could relate to, and who were working
        together to build products that they thought needed to exist. I think
        the thing that surprised me the most was how ambitious some of the
        projects were. There was at least two banks being started at any given
        time, and countless other projects that would be laughable at best, even
        if an industry veteran with 30 years of experience were working on them.
        Yet there was these kids, not so different from me, actually doing this
        stuff successfully. I think so much of this "movement" was framed really
        well by the now-famed essay by Marc Andreessen, entitled
        <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/"
          >IT'S TIME TO BUILD</a
        >. The key idea behind the essay is that it's time for everyone to step
        up and fix the big problems that we as a society face, and I think a lot
        of people from the gen-z community, including myself, really resonated
        with that message. Although the server itself has largely died out,
        perhaps because of some core problems discussed
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/style/gen-z-tech-mafia.html"
          >here</a
        >, I think the energy and movement that was started by that server will
        live on in almost every member, especially those present for the early
        days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many smaller groups have come out of that server, and I'm part of one of
        them - we don't like to talk about this too much, but this group is one
        of the most tight-knit, supportive, and generally driven groups I've
        ever seen. Out of the 31 people that are on the server, I think there
        are like 9 different startups being built who have collectively raised
        millions of dollars and are working on some really hard problems. We
        invest in each-other, with our time, money, and experience, and I expect
        this to pay off exponentially in the next few years. The plan is to
        travel the world together, and eventually get a house in San Francisco
        for the group. Being around people like this has made me into I believe
        a much better person, and as Johnny pointed out a few weeks ago, we've
        gradually become less and less active on the server because we've
        naturally become more and more busy. To note, this isn't a bad thing,
        we've all been pursuing more and more ambitious goals, and if anything,
        it has made us tighter-knit than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, I do think it is worth mentioning that there are
        problems with Silicon Valley. There is absolutely way too much money
        floating around. Sure, this is a great thing since the money will be
        used to fund the next-generation of ambitious companies, but I'm largely
        concerned about some of the patterns that have emerged as a result of
        this access to capital. For instance, so many companies these days,
        especially in Silicon Valley, tend to have hugely unsustainable business
        models, and rely on massive rounds to stay afloat. This makes sense for
        certain, perhaps more capital intensive or hard-tech companies, but it
        doesn't make sense for a small software startup, aka the canonical
        Silicon Valley company. It's hard to say no, especially to millions of
        dollars, but I think the best companies these days are the ones who are
        able to do this, and figure out how to make their product great without
        first raising an enormous round.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another gripe that I have with the valley are the so-called imposters,
        the individuals talking about building without actually really building
        anything. These are the people who spend more on company merchandise
        than research & development, and hire the best frontend engineers to
        make a beautiful website because their product isn't good enough to
        stand on its own. I don't mean to put down anyone specifically here, I
        think overwhelmingly the people in the valley are generally building
        great things, but there are bad apples, and I very much hope that
        Silicon Valley as a whole isn't judged because of the actions of these
        few - they are the minority.
      </p>
      <p>
        To conclude, the spirit and the energy of Silicon Valley is
        intoxicating, and I'm extremely grateful to be a part of this fabulous
        community of builders. I'm really excited to move to California, to not
        only be part of the gen-z lead movement building the next-generation of
        technology, but to finally be home.
