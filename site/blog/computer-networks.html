      <p><strong>The Future of Computer Networks</strong></p>
      <p>Posted: June 7th, 2020</p>
      <p>
        There is no doubt that computer networks, the internet (heard of it?),
        has changed the way that we live our lives. It started out very simply
        as a military experiment, which quickly began to see use within
        communities of researchers at different universities. As the internet
        grew, more and more people had access to this massively expanding
        repository of the worldâ€™s information. It's obvious that the initial
        plan for the internet wasn't to support this many connected machines
        (don't get me started on IPv4...), nevertheless, the internet itself is
        generally considered a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with the seemingly never-ending expansion of the internet is
        somewhat paradoxical: a goal of the internet is to house the worlds
        information, yet a lot of that information shouldn't be on the internet.
        Consider a typical software company, they have a database server along
        with a few application servers which serve requests for their customers.
        Application servers and database servers are networked together, each of
        which are (typically) assigned a public IPv4/IPv6 address and put behind
        a firewall to prevent unauthorized connections. Have you figured out the
        issue yet? We put machines (possibly containing extremely sensitive
        data) on the public network, then try and patch up the holes with
        virtual duct tape. Then for some reason, we're surprised when
        vulnerabilities are found leading to the personal information of 147.9
        million people being exposed (cough Equifax cough).
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution to this problem is simple: some (if not most) machines
        shouldn't be accessible via the public internet. This really isn't a
        breakthrough as cloud computing providers have been pushing for this for
        a while now with VPC systems, and VPN technologies. The concept is
        relatively simple - small, self-contained networks which require
        authentication to join, meaning once you're inside, communications and
        data are private by default. In essence, what I'm trying to get at is
        this idea of a personal (or corporate) internet. Inside this personal
        internet, you're the boss, and you can control who joins this network,
        and who can talk to who within it.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that, we reach the point of this (rant). Enter
        <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> - a startup I'm rather
        fond of, and who I have been a power user of for a while now. Tailscale
        lets you easily make your own personal internet, for free in most cases.
        It's a weird paradigm shift, since inside this internet, you must
        actively work to make your applications insecure rather than the other
        way around. All traffic is encrypted and uses P2P as much as possible
        (DERP servers are used when P2P connections aren't possible -
        essentially an encrypted packet relay, nothing special). For a fun
        anecdote that isn't condoned by my employer, I setup my work machine at
        the office to my personal Tailscale network, and was able to tunnel
        directly into the machine from my house, without being connected to any
        of the corporate VPN nodes (presumably through many firewalls / NATs).
        Pro tip - using a P2P connection for RDP sessions is much preferred over
        a VPN-proxy onto the corporate network, just don't tell IT.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the topic of my employer (who makes some epyc gear), it's worth
        mentioning that adopting Tailscale would be a great move for the
        company. Right now, we have 17 VPN servers worldwide which allow us to
        connect to the corporate network. If we're not in the office, any
        connection we make to another server inside this network has to be
        through one of these VPN servers, which certainly introduces some
        difficulty given that most of our 11,400 employees are working at home
        due to COVID-19. Obviously, productivity is impacted by the load on
        these servers, which leads to RDP sessions being quite sluggish when
        connecting to our work machines. A Tailscale network would alleviate
        most (or all) of our networking problems, since any employee given
        access to the network would be able to make a direct P2P connection (for
        the most part) to any other machines on the network, if allowed to do so
        by the company set access policies. In addition to this, the company
        would also have full observability into the access logs of different
        machines, which could help protect sensitive information on the network.
        You could also say that it would be worth ryzen to the occasion (I'm
        sorry for that one).
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I started at my current employer, I did two internships at a
        YC-backed home security company, which primarily made smart home
        cameras, video doorbells, etc. In this role, I primarily focused on live
        video streaming (bidirectional streaming between home IOT device and
        users smartphone), and let me tell you this: with a few new features
        (notably the ability to pre-authorize clients to connect to a network),
        Tailscale would've been a game changer. Latency was important (ex. it's
        important that users are able to have real-time conversations with
        people who have rung their doorbell), and the ability to easily make
        secure P2P connections between our servers and our cameras would've made
        my job 100x easier. Forget any NAT traversal systems, hole punching, or
        any other dirty networking tactic, it would all have gone away with
        Tailscale.
      </p>
      <p>
        So yeah, with my experience at both an IOT startup and a major
        corporation with severe networking issues, I think I'm uniquely
        qualified to rant about how great Tailscale is. It's a surprisingly
        simple idea, let people create mini sub-internets that they control, and
        Tailscale has done an amazing job making this a reality. I couldn't
        imagine not using Tailscale for my daily work, whether it is SSHing into
        my home servers from anywhere or exploiting the fact that I own the
        network to do cool distributed systems work.
      </p>

        If you want to get started with automatic peer discovery with Tailscale,
        I've
